# Project3-Hulk

## Description 

In a world where remote learning is becoming more popular, we feel that this is the perfect time to leverage technology to encourage positive behavior in class whether online or virtually. Statistics show that students this past year have been struggling with online learning and staying focused and motivated. On track is an application to enforce positive behavior in school and to help keep students motivated while working remotely. Remember “back in the day” when you earned stars for good behavior and placed them on a sticker chart or had to pull your “red card” if you got in trouble? Our modern-day approach for the classic star chart is a great way to encourage positivity among students in a virtual + in-person setting. A user is able to access our website as either a teacher or a student. On track is a perfect way to keep communication going between a teacher and student throughout the year.
